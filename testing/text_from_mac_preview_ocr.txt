New Career in
Cyber... "Who Dis?"
Cybersecurity is the hot new career field. It might even be hotter than the Kardashians.
Why, you ask? To put it simply, technology is spearheading global growth. With new technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning comes more cybersecurity demand. It's the whole supply and demand concept you learned in high school.
While more jobs are becoming remote, virtual, or replaced by robots, how do you think they are protected and secured? Cybersecurity is more than an IT helpdesk or the hackers you see on TV. It's a broad spectrum within all aspects of technology that has made cybersecurity an upward slope for careers, which will not change anytime soon.
What we know today will drastically change from what we know 1 year from now. We know that cybersecurity professionals make great money and get to wear hoodies and flip-flops to work. With all the positives do come some negatives you will learn about within this chapter.
During this chapter you will have me, Jaclyn (Jax) Scott, leading you. You are encouraged to have a notebook close while reading this chapter and following chapters to help with your data retention.
